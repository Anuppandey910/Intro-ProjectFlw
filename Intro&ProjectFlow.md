# Intro
I have 4.5 years of hands-on experience as an Azure Data Engineer at Unitrans Infotech Services Pvt. Ltd., where I've built a solid foundation in cloud-based data engineering. My work focuses on leveraging tools like Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, and PySpark, along with Azure services such as ADF, ADLS Gen2, and ADB. I also have exposure to Snowflake, Kafka, Airflow, and Flask, which helps me adapt quickly to different data environments.

Iâ€™m also comfortable working with project management tools like Jira, GitHub, and Azure DevOps Organisation, which help me stay organized and ensure smooth collaboration within teams.

# Project Flow
One of my recent projects was with RAK Bank, a leading financial institution in the UAE, where I played a major role in migrating their on-premise data systems to Azure. My responsibility was to design data pipelines that would ingest data from various sources like CRM systems, S3 buckets, and SFTP servers into ADLS Gen2. We used a medallion architecture, where raw data was first stored in the Bronze layer, cleaned and transformed using Databricks and PySpark, and eventually stored in the Gold layer for analysis.

In my current role, I also focus on optimizing ETL pipelines to ensure they run smoothly and efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets, by implementing performance tuning techniques and monitoring tools. I proactively identify potential bottlenecks and apply best practices to enhance data processing speed and reliability.
